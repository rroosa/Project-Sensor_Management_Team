LM35 Precision Centigrade Temperature Sensors

3 Description
The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit
temperature devices with an output voltage linearlyproportional to the Centigrade temperature. 
The LM35 device has an advantage over linear
temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user
is not required to subtract a large constant voltage
from the output to obtain convenient Centigrade
scaling. The LM35 device does not require any
external calibration or trimming to provide typical
accuracies of ±¼°C at room temperature and ±¾°C
over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range. Lower
cost is assured by trimming and calibration at the
wafer level.
